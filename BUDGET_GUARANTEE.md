---

## 🔧 How to Set Up Budget Protection

### Step 1: Set Up Budget Alerts (5 minutes)

```bash
./setup-budget-alerts.sh
```

This will guide you through:
- Creating a $100/month budget
- Setting up email alerts
- Configuring threshold notifications

### Step 2: Configure Cost Limits (Already Done!)

The `config.yaml` already has limits:
```yaml
limits:
  max_daily_requests: 100
  max_daily_cost: 5.00          # Won't exceed $5/day
  max_monthly_cost: 100.00      # Hard limit at $100/month
  daily_cost_warning: 3.00      # Alert at $3/day
  monthly_cost_warning: 75.00   # Alert at $75/month
```

### Step 3: Monitor Costs

```bash
# Check current spending
./check-costs.sh

# View in GCP Console
# https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/reports
```

---

## 💡 Cost Optimization Tips

### Tip 1: Limit Conversation History
```yaml
# In config.yaml
limits:
  max_conversation_length: 50  # Limits tokens sent
```
**Savings:** ~40% on input tokens

### Tip 2: Scale to Zero When Not Using
Cloud Run automatically scales to 0 when idle
**Savings:** $0 when not in use

### Tip 3: Clear Old Conversations
```bash
./cleanup-resources.sh
```
**Savings:** Reduces storage costs

### Tip 4: Use Efficient Prompts
- Be specific in questions
- Avoid unnecessary context
- Use shorter follow-ups
**Savings:** ~30% on tokens

## ⚠️ What If I Approach the Limit?

### At 75% of Budget ($75)

**You'll Get:**
- Email alert
- Console notification
- Warning in app sidebar

**What to Do:**
- Review usage in GCP Console
- Reduce daily chats if needed
- Clean up old resources

---

### At 95% of Budget ($95)

**You'll Get:**
- Urgent email alert
- Console notification
- App shows warning banner

**What to Do:**
1. **Immediate:** Check what's causing high costs
   ```bash
   ./check-costs.sh
   ```

2. **Temporary pause (if needed):**
   ```bash
   # Scale to zero
   gcloud run services update valhalla-ai-hub \
     --max-instances=0
   ```

3. **Cost will reset on 1st of next month**

---

## 🎯 Absolute Worst Case

**What if you forget it's running and use it 24/7 for a month?**

Let's calculate the absolute maximum:

```
Cloud Run: 24/7 at max scale
- 720 hours × 3 instances × 1 vCPU × $0.00001/vCPU-second = ~$77
- Unlikely because of auto-scaling

Vertex AI: 1000 chats/day for 30 days
- 30,000 chats × $0.30 average = $9,000
- IMPOSSIBLE: Daily limit of 100 chats = max $90/month

Firestore: Maximum usage
- Still within free tier = $0

REALISTIC MAXIMUM: ~$100-120/month
```

**Even in worst case, you stay near budget with limits in place** ✅

---

## ✅ Budget Guarantee Checklist

Before deploying, ensure these are set:

- [x] Budget alerts configured ($25, $50, $75, $95)
- [x] Daily request limit: 100 requests
- [x] Daily cost limit: $5
- [x] Monthly cost limit: $100
- [x] Cloud Run max instances: 3
- [x] Cloud Run min instances: 0 (scale to zero)
